DEMO SCRIPT


INTRO

Say:
Taxonomy changes are high-stakes. One edit can affect thousands of records and can't be undone.

This agent acts as a safety layer. It analyzes your change against real data and gives you a verdict.

2 Enable Edit Mode top-right

DEMO 1 - APPROVED

Rename Sub-Theme


Navigate to path above then:
Click theme Scheduling Blocked by Error Messages
Click sub-theme Unknown Error During Scheduling


Do:
Click edit icon on sub-theme name
Rename to Scheduling Error Messages
Click Get Agent Recommendation


Highlight:
APPROVED with High confidence
Shows full taxonomy path
Lists sibling sub-themes
No conflicts detected
Green button Apply Changes


Say:
Rename is low-risk. Records stay mapped. Agent confirms no sibling conflicts and the new name better describes the feedback.




DEMO 2 - REJECTED

Merge Two Unrelated Sub-Themes


Navigate to path above then:
Click theme Scheduling Blocked by Error Messages
Click sub-theme Calendar Connection Errors


Do:
Click merge icon
Select Permission Denied Messages as destination
Click Get Agent Recommendation


Highlight:
REJECTED with Low confidence
Low semantic similarity between sub-themes
Different root causes in feedback
Would lose granularity
Button Contact Enterpret


Say:
Agent blocks this merge. Calendar errors and permission errors are different issues. Merging would lose the ability to track them separately.




CLOSING

Say:
Two verdicts. Approved when safe, Rejected when risky. The agent validates every edit against real data.
